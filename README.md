## Hi there 👋
I'm Leon, a developer.

1. I'm currently working on an arch-based linux distro (Debian and Arch are absolute 🐐 GOATS.).

2. I'm also planning making a distro based on the distro in point 1.

3. A linux distro (again) based on DebianTesting or DebianUnstable (Probably DebianTesting, we will see.).

You can check out all of them here:

2. [@leon8326-goosepack](https://github.com/leon8326-goosepack/)

3. (Idk what to name it, i'll edit this once i find a name for it.)

(I'm using Debian on my personal computer, if anyone asks.)
