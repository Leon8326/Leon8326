## Hi there 👋
I'm Leon, a developer.

1. I'm currently working on an arch-based linux distro (Debian and Arch are absolute 🐐 GOATS.).

2. I'm also planning making a distro based on the distro in point 1.

(Changed my plans, not making distro 3.)

You can check out all of them here:

1. [Nogeese Linux (@leon8326-nogeese)](https://github.com/leon8326-nogeese/)

2. [Goosepack Linux (@leon8326-goosepack)](https://github.com/leon8326-goosepack/)

(I'm using Nogeese Linux on my personal computer, if anyone asks.)
